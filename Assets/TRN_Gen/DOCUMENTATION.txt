TRN_Gen:

To use the terrain generator, first add the TRN_Generator script to your terrain. From there you can add Noise Layers from the Noise dropdown
and customise them to your liking. Each Noise Layer has a set of filters you can customise, which allow even greater control over the shape of
the terrain. You can also add prefabs and grass textures to be procedurally scattered on your terrain. For best results, set the heightmap resolution 
of your terrain to 1024 and the detail resolution to 4032.
